CHANGES
=======

0.2 (2014-10-27)
----------------

- Now prints a summary in the end.

- Regard more virtualenv tests as failures.

- Return 1 if not all tests succeeded.

- Fall back to setup.cfg is there is no spiny config file.

- Renamed spiny.conf to spiny.cfg for consistency.

- Made the configuration file optional.

- Spiny will now grep setup.py for Python version classifiers if no
  environment configuration is found.

- If both Python X and Python X.Y is given as environments, it will
  skip the tests for Python X, seeing as it is fulfilled by Python X.Y.

- The version specified in the [pythons] section now have preference.

- Setting a config option from the command line now works even if the section
  doesn't exist.

- Spiny will now attempt to extract the test requirements and install them
  into the virtualenv before running the tests, to avoid polluting the
  project directory with .egg directories.
