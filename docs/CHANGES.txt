CHANGES
=======

0.4 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.3 (2014-10-30)
----------------

- Now runs under Python 3, PyPy, PyPy3, Jython.

- All output is now through logging, which enables you to select verbosity.

- Added --version, --verbose and --quiet options.

- Now use subprocess32 under Python 2.

- Will now run tests in parallell with multiprocessing. A 'max-processes'
  option in the [spiny] section will allow you to cap the processes if
  you don't want to max your computer. Otherwise it will use as many processes
  as multiprocessing will report cpu's.


0.2 (2014-10-27)
----------------

- Now prints a summary in the end.

- Regard more virtualenv tests as failures.

- Return 1 if not all tests succeeded.

- Fall back to setup.cfg is there is no spiny config file.

- Renamed spiny.conf to spiny.cfg for consistency.

- Made the configuration file optional.

- Spiny will now grep setup.py for Python version classifiers if no
  environment configuration is found.

- If both Python X and Python X.Y is given as environments, it will
  skip the tests for Python X, seeing as it is fulfilled by Python X.Y.

- The version specified in the [pythons] section now have preference.

- Setting a config option from the command line now works even if the section
  doesn't exist.

- Spiny will now attempt to extract the test requirements and install them
  into the virtualenv before running the tests, to avoid polluting the
  project directory with .egg directories.


0.1.1 (2014-10-18)
